## Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build CSS: `npm run build` (or `npm run build:debug` for verbose output)
4. Open `index.html` in your browser

### Build Process

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The build process compiles the utility classes from `src/input.css` into the final `styles.css` file.

**Available Scripts:**
- `npm run build` - Build CSS for production
- `npm run build:debug` - Build CSS with verbose logging
- `npm run watch` - Watch for changes and rebuild automatically

**Note:** Make sure to run the build command after making changes to HTML files or Tailwind classes to ensure all utility classes are generated properly.
