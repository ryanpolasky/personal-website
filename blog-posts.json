I wanted to create something that felt a bit more personal and nerdy than a standard blog template.\n\nHere, you can navigate my thoughts using familiar commands. Try typing `help` to see what you can do. It's simple, but I at least think it's neat.\n\nThis page is mainly for myself to jot down spurious thoughts, but who knows, maybe someone takes a smidgen of interest in something I have to say.\n\nRegardless, I hope you enjoy your stay.\n\n-- Ryan"
